# Purpose
<p>The purpose of this app is to calculate the carbon footprint of a trip based on user input, including the departure airport, arrival airport, number of passengers, and travel class. The app utilizes various technologies and APIs to provide accurate calculations and promote eco-friendly travel choices.</p>

<ul>
  <li>User-friendly interface to enter trip details</li>
  <li>Integration with airport code database API for accurate airport selection</li>
  <li>Utilization of GoClimate's carbon footprint calculation function</li>
  <li>Display of the calculated carbon footprint value</li>
</ul>

# Technologies and APIs
<p>The project is built using the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>React-icons: a library of customizable icons for React applications</li>

</ul>

# Plus: A.I.
<p>In this porject, for the very first time, I used the A.I. to help me debug the code while I was in trouble, and at the same time I practised this incredible and powerful tool, checkin' out the pros and the cons.</p>
